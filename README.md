## ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ivan and I'm and illustrator and designer learning to code for front-end web development. 

### âœ¨ Goals
- **Front-end Web Development:** I can build websites with no code tools, but I want to learn how to build websites from the ground up with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the current frameworks that are available. 

- **Linux and Open Source:** I really don't like the direction Windows is going in, and I see linux is the best option. As a designer I'll still keep Windows. I've moved away from Adobe and I'm currently use the Affinity Suite for all my design needs. I think it's a perfect replacement and it works great! I started using Davinci Resolve for video editing projects. I know there are open source options available and currently learning Krita and Inkscape. For 90% of what I do, including web development, linux is the perfect option.

### ðŸ§© Current Project
- **Portfolio Website:** Currently I'm working on my illustration portfolio website. I'm building a static website using Astro. I went with Astro becuase it seems to be very popular and there's a lot of great documentation around it. It also seems to be a great option as my knowledge of frameworks grows, I'll be able to take advantage of the features Astro offers.

### ðŸŽ¨ Future Projects
- **Creative Coding:** Something I've recently come across is the concept of creative coding. I love the idea of combining art, design, typography, and code to create something that unique and expressive. My brain needs both analytical and abstract inputs. As much as I love painting with watercolors, I love to code, and this is a perfect balance of the two and it will be fun to explore as my skills and understanding of programming grows. 

- **Game Dev:** This sounds pretty big, and it's more of an itch I'd like to scratch if I find the time. I'd love to build a retro style game. Something close to an NES or Gameboy Color game. I think it would be fun, at least 10 year old me would think so. Me in the far future would also like to build a low poly game! Something similar in style to a Sega Saturn or PS1 game. Again, this would be for fun. If I break into the game industry, awesome! If not, then no big deal.

### ðŸŽ® Fun Facts and Hobbies!
- **Kid Lit:** I'm currently working on becoming a children's book/graphic novel writer and illustrator.

- **Gaming:** When I find time I play retro games on my Ambernic RG 35XX SP. It's also a great travel companion! I'm currently playing Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers on my 3DS. I just started the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. This is my first time playing Mass Effect and it's pretty amazing! 

- **Photography:** Street photography is something I love to do when I go out. I love shooting with old cameras. It's fun, sometimes challenging, and if my camera gets lost or stolen then it's no big deal.
